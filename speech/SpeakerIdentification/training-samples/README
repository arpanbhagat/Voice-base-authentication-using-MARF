$Header: /cvsroot/marf/apps/SpeakerIdentApp/training-samples/README,v 1.1 2003/02/01 15:07:01 mokhov Exp $

This directory is supposed to contain WAV files
(*.wav) for TRAINING a trained system. There may
also be some generated files, like PPM or CSV
text files with wave graphs (-graph) or
spectrograms (-spectrogram) if such options were
specified to the application.

If you add a file here, don't forget to update
the speakers.txt file one level up; otherwise,
the file won't be processed.

This README is primarily here for the directory
to 100% exist when distributed w/o samples. :-)
