GENERALITIES
------------

NOTE: This demo application utilizes the MARF framework.
      You have to have the latest marf-<version>.jar file, which
      you can obtain from <http://marf.sf.net/>, and put it
      somewhere under your CLASSPATH, EXTDIRS (Java's
      extesions directory), or application itself.
      The -bin and -bundle distros have the .jar file within them,
      but it may not be the latest). You will
      need JDK/JRE 1.4 or higher for it to function properly.

This is (still) a console-based application. GUI is still being
planned out.

For the fresh install you need to retrain the system before
you can start feeding testing samples into it. If you
work with our sample set, to save some time you may download our
trainin-sets tarball with pre-trained data.


BUILDING FROM SOURCES
---------------------

(This does not apply to you if you downloaded the binary-only distro.)


UNIXen

It is assumed you have a GNU-style make, which comes
under some UNIXen under the name gmake.

Type:

$ make

	to build it

$ make train-run

	to build, train the system, and then test

$ make test-run

	to just batch-test it w/o retraining

$ make javadoc-html

	to make a javadoc-style reference to the application's code;
	the generated documents will be placed under the ./html subdirectory

$ make clean

	to remove all .class files

$ make maintainer-clean

	to also remove output, text, ppm, log, diff, and some
	other temp. developer files

NOTE: You may need to tweak the Makefile for your specific preferences.


Windows

For JBuilder users there is the SpeakerIdentApp.jpx project
file, you can use that if you are unfamiliar with
the make utility or suffer from its unavailability.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Besides this README, ChangeLog, and the javadoc reference,
this application doesn't have any documentation within itself.
It's documented however along with the MARF framework itself,
and the MARF's report-manual. Grab it's PDF version from either
MARF's -doc distro or the our web page: <http://marf.sf.net>.
