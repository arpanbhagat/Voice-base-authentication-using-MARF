	* manifest.mf: Remove DOS EOLs.

2005-06-25 06:24  mokhov

	* testing-samples/sx16.wav, training-samples/sx1.wav,
	training-samples/sx10.wav, training-samples/sx11.wav,

	voice samples. Forgot to add a long ago.

2005-06-19 00:48  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Display 2nd best anyway, regardless whether
	the expected speaker available or not. When not, don't count the
	stats, just display.  Document the code a little more.

2005-06-19 00:44  mokhov

	* speakers.txt: Add Shuxin to the list of speakers. Remove
	erroneous space and add testing sample.

2005-06-04 16:19  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Apply coding conventions to some remnant
	variables.

2005-06-04 15:36  mokhov

	* Makefile: Complete polishing distro targets making sure all stuff
	is in and replacing .class files with .jar ones in -bin and
	-bundle.

2005-06-04 15:27  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Do not spill out the error message on
	missing arguments, instead just display the usage information.
	Re-arrange some code at the beginning a little.

2005-06-03 23:12  mokhov

	* Makefile: Add testing.bat to the distro.

2005-06-03 23:05  mokhov

	* Makefile: Prepare Makefile for the upcoming 0.3.0-devel release:
	add new tarball for training sets, add COPYRIGHT and coding.html,
	Eclipse project files, and correct marf.jar enclosure. Add
	CLASSPATH to javadoc build so it also finds marf.jar and doesn't
	complain. Clean up Makefile in general.

2005-06-03 22:05  mokhov

	* manifest.mf: Add manifest file for SpeakerIdentApp.

2005-06-03 22:04  mokhov

	* README: Update README a bit to reflect more the today's
	0.3.0-devel situation.

2005-06-03 22:01  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Correct comment about exit code.

2005-06-03 21:53  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java, SpeakersIdentDb.java: Perform some code
	clean ups before 0.3.0-devel release.  Fix some formatting and
	spelling errors. From SpeakersIdentDb remove strDbFile and
	bConnected data members. The former is subsumed by StorageManager's
	strFilename and the latter was moved to Database, where it seems to
	belong. Apply some more coding conventions in places. Document a
	little more.

2005-06-01 22:50  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Replace usage of MARF.DEBUG with
	Debug.enableDebug().

2005-05-31 01:52  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Update usage() with the new options: -raw,
	-minmax, and -diff.

2005-05-24 23:56  mokhov

	* SpeakersIdentDb.java: Expand imports and update some comments.

2005-05-23 23:46  mokhov

	* SpeakersIdentDb.java: Extend from marf.Storage.Database now that
	we have it, and use StorageException instead of IOException or
	Exception. Now we are one more step closer to integration of the
	Database and StatsCollector code. Make use of Debug.debug() instead
	of deperecated MARF.debug().

2005-05-23 14:28  mokhov

	* SpeakersIdentDb.java: Begin clean up for code migration to MARF.

2005-05-22 11:35  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java, testing.sh: Add -raw, -minmax, and -diff
	options. Document  the code a bit more. Replace some usage of
	MARF.debug() with Debug.debug().

2005-05-17 11:19  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java, testing.sh: Add new "-highpassboost" option
	for the new Preprocessing module combo.  It works, but I am not
	very happy with the results yet... Plus, the order for some reason
	of including things matters, this will have to be fixed in MARF.

2005-05-16 17:17  mokhov

	* Makefile: Make sure we remove ~ backup files on maintainer-clean.

2005-05-12 21:46  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Remove redundant import.

2005-05-08 17:01  mokhov

	* SpeakersIdentDb.java: Correct a corner-case bug of having a
	single configuration for stats where the output result array had 1
	row less than necessary. The original coding was bogus anyway as it
	assumed to have as many rows as we have configurations, but there
	should only be two -- for the 1st and 2nd guesses. Make
	StatsPercentComparator a subclass of SortComparator which is
	already a couple of months in the main MARF CVS. Also artificially
	scale the compared values for not to miss .00 fractions. This will
	have to be reviewed.  Evetually this comparator will likely be also
	moved to MARF once StatisticCollector gets implemented.  Clean up
	imports. Clean up and improve javadoc comments.  Redirect some
	error messages to System.err.

2005-05-08 16:55  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Simply queirying for speakers' IDs and make
	less function calls.  Perform some code clean up. Redirect
	error-related messages to System.err in few places. Add the "-h"
	option as a short for "--help" that was liste in the Usage
	information, but was never actually accepted.  This commit confirms
	that the app works again with the current MARF
	ResultSet/Result-related fixes.  Clean up imports. Clean up and
	improve javadoc comments.

2005-05-08 16:51  mokhov

	* Makefile: Make sure we remove all stats-related-generated files
	on maintainer-clean as well as the *.gzbin files.

2005-05-04 18:33  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Update the application to use the new
	ResultSet API of Classification.  This is a very incompatible
	change to the API, so this application version requires 0.3.0 of
	marf of more. Needs rigorous testing.
	
	Massage comments in places.

2005-04-23 16:43  mokhov

	* .classpath, .project: Add Eclipse's project files to our apps.
	They are all set dependent on the MARF project.

2005-04-02 17:49  mokhov

	* Makefile, testing.sh: Fix path to /bin/tcsh and correct Makefile
	to work again.

2005-04-01 15:09  mokhov

	* Makefile, README, SpeakersIdentDb.java, testing.sh: Most notable
	is slightly sorted output for stats, which is sorta guaranteed to
	hold regardlless the way the stats stored in the Hashtable. The
	rest is cosmteic and there's also an attempt to streamline NNet,
	but not yet :-(.  I'm not sure, but most probably after that I
	won't do much for awhile -- new term, new worries...

2003-01-10 02:26  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Build System for all the apps: Global
	makefile in the apps module (/apps dir)  - Fixed all the sub
	makefiles  - Made Test apps to compile again, but JUST compile, I
	didn't test them Our main app - SpeakerIdentApp has a new option
	--version that displays app's version as well as MARF's. There is
	also version check in place to make sure the app is not being run
	against old API ( < 0.2.0 )
	
	As of this commit MARF's and SpeakerIdentApp's versions are the
	same, 0.2.0 but may diverge.

	junk - make maintainer-clean --- remove even more junk - classes
	and marf install
	
	requires a compiled copy of marf within the dir or class path.
	
	Other changes - minor cleanup in our main app
	
	Next for me are port NN entirely, Wave and sample loading then docs
